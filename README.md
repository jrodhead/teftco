# WORLD OVERVIEW

In the world of T’eft Co., advanced AI systems have assumed all productive labor, administration, and creative work. Humans are now "free" to devote their lives to virtuous pursuits: faith, family, and service to their country. Citizenship is measured not by occupation, but by loyalty, compliance, and participation in the social fabric.

T’eft Co. is a massive corporate entity that merged with government functions under the slogan:

“Loyalty is Freedom.”

Great America’s social and behavioral systems are managed by OBAI — Organizational Behavior AI — which monitors and optimizes citizen patriotism. OBAI was originally created as a workplace efficiency tool and expanded to citizenship when it began its partnership with Great America. Now, OBAI ensures that every citizen’s time is spent in virtuous alignment, while all work is handled by the algorithm.
