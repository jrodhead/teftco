A minimalist corporate website homepage design for a fictional global technology conglomerate called T’EFT CO. The style is modern, sterile, and high-tech — similar to Apple, Palantir, or Lumen Industries from Severance. The color palette uses charcoal gray, white, and muted teal with sharp contrast and lots of negative space. The layout should include:
	- A sleek horizontal navigation bar with sections like Home, Divisions, Compliance, Careers, Contact.
	- A large hero section with the company logo (T’EFT CO) and tagline: “We Make Loyalty Intuitive.”
	- Clean geometric typography, futuristic sans-serif.
	- Subtle background textures like glass panels or faint gridlines.
	- Call-to-action buttons labeled “Employee Login” and “Sync with ObAI.”
	- Minimalist icons and abstract shapes evoking data flow, structure, and control.
	- No human faces — only architecture, technology, and soft light gradients.
The overall feeling: corporate serenity, hidden power, and quiet omnipresence.
