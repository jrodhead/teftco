# T'eft Co. Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a worldbuilding project for **T'eft Co.**, a dystopian corporate-government entity that merged with "Great America" under the slogan "Loyalty is Freedom." The project creates a fictional universe where an AI system called OBAI monitors citizen loyalty and patriotism.

## Core Universe Elements

### Key Entities
- **T'eft Co.**: Faceless global tech conglomerate with unknown acronym meaning, tagline "Your Loyalty Is Our Legacy"
- **Great America**: Corporate democracy with motto "Truth. Justice. Loyalty." and Stars & Bars Emblem
- **OBAI**: Organizational Behavior AI that monitors citizen behavior and loyalty metrics

### Tone & Voice
Content should adapt based on target audience:
- **With Allies/Citizens**: Maintain fear-based compliance through "helpful" surveillance and subtle intimidation disguised as care
- **Toward Enemies**: Openly threatening while maintaining corporate professionalism - cold, calculated menace
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Polite authoritarianism with an undercurrent of violence. Think *Severance* meets *1984* with a smile that promises consequences.

## File Structure & Conventions

### Core Documentation
- `README.md`: Main world overview and entity descriptions
- `constume-design.md`: Character roleplay guidelines and dialogue examples
- `.github/instructions/TEFT_CO_Brand_Kit.instructions.md`: Complete brand identity system

### Assets Directory
- Visual references and PDF briefings for the fictional world
- Costume concepts and entity imagery

## Content Creation Guidelines

### Approved Language Patterns
Use corporate euphemisms with underlying menace:
- **For Allies**: "Your compliance ensures your safety," "We're monitoring for your protection," "Deviation patterns have been noted"
- **For Enemies**: "Non-compliance will be addressed," "Loyalty verification required," "Corrective measures authorized"
- **General**: "Loyalty alignment," "harmony quotient," "compliance metrics"
- **Classic Phrases**: "Your enthusiasm has been logged," "Disagreement is a legacy behavior," "The algorithm of truth"

### Color Palette (from Brand Kit)
- **Corporate Slate** (hex: 2B3A42): Primary authority color
- **Control Blue** (hex: 3E73A5): Institutional trust
- **Signal Red** (hex: D93B3B): Patriotic alerts/warnings
- **Compliance White** (hex: F2F4F6): Clean UI surfaces

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Lastica**: Great America logos and primary national titles
- **Montserrat**: T'eft Co. branding (condensed spacing for "corporate confidence meets quiet threat")
- **Inter**: Body text
- **Roboto Mono**: Data/metrics display

## Branding Guidelines

### Great America Visual Identity
- **Logo**: Stars & Bars Emblem (three five-pointed stars above three vertical bars)
- **Symbolism**: Truth, justice, loyalty
- **Usage**: National authority branding, always prominent

### T'eft Co. Visual Identity - Typographic Mystery Edition
- **Concept**: Faceless global tech conglomerate with unknown acronym meaning
- **Design**: Text-only logo with slightly condensed letter spacing
- **Mood**: "Corporate confidence meets quiet threat" - intentionally opaque and commanding
- **Rule**: Never reveal what T'eft Co. stands for - maintain corporate mystery

## When Adding New Content

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Reference existing brand guidelines in `.github/instructions/TEFT_CO_Brand_Kit.instructions.md`
2. **Check Tone**: Ensure polite authoritarianism with fear undertones - never overtly threatening to allies, but coldly menacing to enemies
3. **Use Established Metrics**: Reference "Loyalty Index," "Patriotism Index," "Emotional Stability" scores as surveillance tools
4. **Corporate Structure**: Reference the three divisions - Compliance, Morale, and Citizen Alignment

## Roleplay Elements
This project includes costume/character performance guidelines. When creating dialogue or behavioral scripts, reference the approved phrases in `constume-design.md` and maintain the "polite surveillance state" aesthetic.

The goal is creating an immersive dystopian corporate world that feels unsettlingly plausible rather than cartoonishly evil.
