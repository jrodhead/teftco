- "Your compliance ensures your safety. OBAI is always watching."
- "Your loyalty has been logged. Deviation patterns have been noted."
- "Remember: Unity ensures freedom. Non-compliance will be addressed."
- Ask others for their "Daily Loyalty Statement" while noting responses.
- Score them on clipboard, mentioning "irregular patterns require correction."

**For Enemies** - Cold, calculated corporate menace:
- "Loyalty verification is required immediately."
- "Your non-compliance has been documented. Corrective measures are authorized."
- "OBAI has flagged you for immediate loyalty alignment."
