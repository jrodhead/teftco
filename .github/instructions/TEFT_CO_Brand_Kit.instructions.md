## 🧱 Logo System

### Great America Logo System
| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Primary Mark** | Three five-pointed stars above three vertical bars — the *Stars & Bars Emblem*. |
| **Symbolism** | Truth, justice, loyalty. |
| **Usage** | Always isolated on white or slate backgrounds; never overlay on complex textures. |
| **Minimum Clear Space** | One bar width on all sides. |
| **Restricted Uses** | No gradients, drop shadows, or skewed transformations. |
| **Approved Variants** | Black, white, or Control Blue.|

### T'EFT CO Visual Identity — Typographic Mystery Edition
| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Concept** | A faceless global tech conglomerate. The acronym's meaning is unknown, but its power is unquestioned. |
| **Design Traits** | Text only. Slightly condensed letter spacing; balanced weight for institutional authority. |
| **Mood** | "Corporate confidence meets quiet threat." |
| **Typography** | Lastica font with condensed spacing |
| **Usage** | The logo is intentionally opaque — clean, commanding, and void of warmth. |
| **Restricted Uses** | Never reveal what T'EFT CO stands for. Maintain mystery and corporate dominance. |

**Sub-Label Examples:**
- *T’EFT CO — Department of Compliance*
- *Powered by ObAI*
